# Pages (`src/pages`)

Route-level React views. Shared chrome comes from [src/components/](../components/README.md).

## Overview

| Path | Summary |
| --- | --- |
| [HomeRedirect.tsx](HomeRedirect.tsx) | / — sends users to sign-in, register, or profile |
| [SignIn/](SignIn/README.md) | /sign-in — account creation and sign-in |
| [Register/](Register/README.md) | /register — application form and success step |
| [Profile/](Profile/README.md) | /profile — applicant dashboard |

## Route map

| Path | Component | Auth |
| --- | --- | --- |
| / | HomeRedirect | Redirect logic only |
| /sign-in | SignInPage | Public |
| /register | RegisterPage | Required; blocks if already submitted |
| /profile | ProfilePage | Required |
| * | Navigate → / | — |

Defined in [main.tsx](../main.tsx).

## HomeRedirect logic

| Condition | Destination |
