# Register flow (`src/pages/Register`)

Multi-step registration: application form, draft autosave, submit, brief success screen.

## Overview

| Path | Summary |
| --- | --- |
| [RegisterPage.tsx](RegisterPage.tsx) | Step shell (application \| success); storm frame + sign-out |
| [ApplicationForm.tsx](ApplicationForm.tsx) | Full MLH application UI, draft load/save, submit (custom dropdowns; no remount on draft hydrate). Sections include **Application Questions** (`hackathonsAttended`, `experienceLevel`, two mandatory multiline answers) and **Event Preferences** (dietary options, `allergyDetails` when Allergies is checked, optional `otherDietaryRestrictions`). |
| [registerApi.ts](registerApi.ts) | Resume upload HTTP + registrations:register + resumeUploads:discardUploadSession |
| [SuccessStep.tsx](SuccessStep.tsx) | Post-submit celebration; links to profile and landing |
| [constants.ts](constants.ts) | Re-exports form options from [shared/registration/](../../../shared/registration/) |
| [components/](components/README.md) | Form field widgets |
